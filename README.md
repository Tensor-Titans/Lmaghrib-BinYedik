## Approach

<img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/G/google-lens-logo-0F69C74B83-seeklogo.com.png" width="75" height="75" alt="Google Lens">

Our solution leverages the Google Lens API to perform searches for images related to an input image, focusing specifically on Moroccan monuments. 
This approach allows us to gather a broad range of related images.

We then utilize the LLM, LLaMA3, to process and analyze the associated image data, enabling it to pinpoint the exact name of the monument depicted.

With the monumentâ€™s name identified, LLaMA3 serves a dual role. It acts as an interactive tool to answer and elaborate on queries about the monument, providing users with detailed, accessible explanations and enhancing their overall understanding.
